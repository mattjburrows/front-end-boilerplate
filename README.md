# Introduction

Welcome to the Essence Digital front-end development boilerplate. The thought behind this repository is to provide a framework to quickly build front-end solutions harnessing the power of [Grunt js](http://gruntjs.com/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).

# Usage

* Download the project and un-zip the project in your folder structure on your development environment.
* Open up __package.json__ and edit the _name_ property to the name of your project.

## Grunt

* Open up Terminal (or whatever interface you use to use to access the command line) and locate the root directory of your new project.
* Make sure you can see the __Gruntfile.js__ and __package.json__ files in the folder and then type in _grunt_

What this will do is run the tasks that have been set up in __Gruntfile.js__, you can see by default it has SASS, Uglify and Watch setup by default.
