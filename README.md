# Introduction

Welcome to the Essence Digital front-end development boilerplate. The thought behind this repository is to provide a framework to quickly build front-end solutions harnessing the power of [Grunt js](http://gruntjs.com/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).

# Usage

* Download the project and un-zip the project in your folder structure on your development environment.
* Open up __package.json__ and edit the _name_ property to the name of your project.
